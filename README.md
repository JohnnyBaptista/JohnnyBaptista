### Hi there! I'm JP Baptista 👋

I'm a **Frontend Engineer** with a strong focus on developer experience, scalable architectures and performance. I love exploring how things work under the hood — from **JavaScript internals** to **low-level system behavior**, and I often build tools to make developers' lives easier.

🧩 **What I’ve been diving deeper into:**
- **Microfrontends** using Module Federation (Webpack 5)
- **Monorepos** with tools like TurboRepo and Nx
- **Design systems** and component libraries
- **Dev tool automation** (CLIs, scripts, internal tools)
- **ElectronJS apps** for desktop utilities
- **System architecture** for scalable frontends
- **MCP Servers** for productivity

💼 **Currently working at [GoBots](https://gocommerce.gobots.com.br/)** as a Frontend Engineer helping build intelligent retail automation platforms. I'm also active in internal architecture discussions, UI design reviews, and tooling decisions.

---

🧪 **I like to experiment with:**
- Building CLI tools (e.g. for microfrontend scaffolding)
- Performance testing with K6 and WebSocket load simulations
- Desktop apps with screenshot, OCR and keyboard control features
- AI-enhanced workflows (categorizing financial data, behavior analysis)

---

📌 **Notable Projects:**
- 🎨 [Screen Drawer](https://github.com/JohnnyBaptista/screen-drawer) – Cross-platform screen drawing tool built with ElectronJS.
   [emf CLI](https://github.com/JohnnyBaptista/emf) *(WIP)* – CLI to scaffold and manage microfrontend projects using Module Federation.

🎓 Always learning about:
- Computer science fundamentals (compilers, parsers, low-level concepts)
- System design and distributed architectures
- Developer ergonomics and productivity
